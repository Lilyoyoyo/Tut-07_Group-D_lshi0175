# Interactive Artwork: Nasreen Mohamedi's "Untitled-1"

## Instructions on How to Interact with the Work
- **Change Color**: Select a color using the color picker and click "Apply Color."
- **Line Weight**: Enter a value between 1 and 10 and click "Apply Weight."
- **Number of Lines**: Enter a value between 1 and 100 and click "Apply Number."
- **Line Angle**: Enter a degree value between -360 and 360 and click "Apply Angle."
- **Mouse Interaction**: Move the mouse horizontally to change line colors, and drag vertically to adjust line positions.
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Press 'R' to increase line lengths and 'S' to decrease line lengths.

## Individual Approach to Animating the Group Code
I expanded the base code by creating features that enable users to directly edit features of the artwork in real-time via different inputs.

## Inspiration for Animating the Individual Code
This idea was derived from digital artworks where the work being the focus, incorporates the user and can be changed in real time. I intended to design an environment so that the users become a direct part of the art so that it becomes more interactive in nature.

## Technical Explanation of the Individual Code
The code includes functions to handle user inputs from HTML elements:
- `changeColor()`: Updates the line colors.
- `changeLineWeight()`, `changeNumLines()`, `changeLineAngle()`: Modify the line properties based on user inputs.
- `mouseMoved()`, `mouseDragged()`: Change line colors and positions based on mouse interactions.
- `keyPressed()`: Adjust line lengths using keyboard inputs.

## Differences
My task is different from the group task in that it includes a typed input, which my group did not incorporate into their respective picture. This approach also sets aside my work from other group members tasks where some of the participants may have employed audio or time-based animations.
